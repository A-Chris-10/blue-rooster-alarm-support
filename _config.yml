# Billing & Subscription Help

If Blue Rooster Alarm includes paid features, this page helps troubleshoot purchase access.

## Step 1 — Confirm you’re signed into the correct account
Purchases are tied to the store account (App Store / Google Play) and sometimes to your in-app login.

## Step 2 — Restore purchases
Look for **Restore Purchases** in Settings (if available) and try it.

## Step 3 — Confirm the charge
Check your App Store / Google Play purchase history.

## Step 4 — Still missing features?
Submit a ticket with:
- Platform (iOS/Android/Web)
- What you purchased and when
- Screenshot of the receipt (remove sensitive info if you prefer)
